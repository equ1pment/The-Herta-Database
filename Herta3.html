                <h3>
                Creations and Reflections: The Space Station, Puppets, and the Simulated Universe
                </h3>
                <p>
                Herta's genius is not confined to the theoretical; it manifests in tangible and digital creations that are as complex and revealing as their creator. Her three most significant projects—the Herta Space Station, her legion of puppets, and the Simulated Universe—are not merely the products of her work but are, in fact, physical and digital externalizations of her psyche. Each creation serves as a mirror, reflecting a different facet of her personality, motivations, and internal world. The Space Station is her archive, the puppets are her evolving identity, and the Simulated Universe is her boundless ambition. To analyze them is to map the architecture of her mind.

                <h3>
                The Herta Space Station: A Museum of Curiosities
                </h3>
                <p>
                The genesis of the Herta Space Station lies in Herta's foundational boredom with the common world. It was conceived as a "museum-like starship," a vessel designed to travel the cosmos and "seal all strange existences among the stars". Its primary purpose is to serve as a repository for her vast and ever-growing collection of "Curios"—rare and inexplicable artifacts gathered from across the galaxy. It is, in essence, a physical archive of her intellectual journey, a library of cosmic puzzles she has deemed worthy of her attention.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                However, the station's origin story contains a layer of profound responsibility that complicates its identity as a mere hobbyist's collection. A primary motivation for its construction was to safely contain an unactivated Stellaron, thereby protecting her home planet, The Blue, from a potential cataclysm. This act positions the station not just as a museum but as a shield, a monumental feat of engineering created for the specific purpose of planetary defense.
                </p>
                <p>
                Despite this crucial role, Herta's relationship with her eponymous creation is one of profound detachment. Once her initial curiosity in its design and purpose was sated, she deemed it an "abandoned interest". She views it as little more than a "warehouse" for her collection and has delegated its entire management and operation to her lead researcher, Asta. She is famously indifferent to the station's fate, caring little for its day-to-day happenings or even major crises like an invasion by the Antimatter Legion. Her interest is only rekindled when her ownership is directly challenged or when someone dares to taunt her, suggesting her connection is one of pride rather than affection.
                </p>

                <h3>
                The Puppets as Portraits: An Evolving Self-Image
                </h3>
                <p>
                Herta's puppets are the most visible and personal of her creations. She is adamant that they are not mere tools or remote-controlled drones but are integral extensions of her own being. To codify this unity, she insists on the moniker "The Herta," a title that encompasses her hidden, true self and her network of over 281 puppets (249 active and 32 backups) as a single, cohesive entity.
                </p>
                <p>
                These puppets are meticulously designed to be approximately 70% similar to her own appearance as a child. This specific choice, combined with a recurring "toy motif" that permeates her character—her splash art depicts her playing with the Trailblazers as sock puppets, and the station is likened to a giant toybox—suggests a deep psychological connection to her past. It hints at a desire to relive, reclaim, or perhaps exert control over a childhood she may have lost to the burdens of her own genius or found otherwise unsatisfactory.
                </p>
                <p>
                The lore associated with her personal Light Cone, "Birth of the Self," is the key to understanding this dynamic. The text describes her as constantly tweaking the puppets' design, not for mechanical improvement, but for self-expression: "Completely different from yesterday. This is more like who I am today". This reveals that the puppets are not static representations but active, evolving "portraits" in an ongoing process of self-definition and self-creation. They are her way of performing and refining her identity in a safe, controlled medium. The Light Cone's artwork deepens this mystery, depicting a puppet holding a series of portraits, which in turn hold other portraits, creating an infinite regression that culminates not in an image of Herta, but in a symbol of chains surrounding an unknown object. This powerful imagery suggests that this process of self-creation is also an act of containment, that something is being hidden or locked away at the very core of her identity.

                <h3>
                The Simulated Universe: Deconstructing Divinity
                </h3>
                <p>
                The Simulated Universe (SU) stands as Herta's most ambitious and intellectually audacious project. It is a grand collaborative effort, developed in partnership with three other members of the Genius Society: the master of life sciences, Ruan Mei (#81); the erudite mechanist, Screwllum; and the enigmatic Stephen Lloyd.
                </p>
                <p>
                The project's singular, stated goal is as profound as it is perilous: to unravel the deepest mysteries of the universe, namely the nature of the Aeons and the Paths they embody. The SU functions as a complex cosmological engine, a virtual copy of the real universe that can simulate historical events and alternate realities. By running these simulations, Herta and her colleagues can observe the behavior of god-like entities from a safe, controlled distance, effectively placing divinity itself under a microscope.
                </p>
                <p>
                The existence and function of the SU are inextricably linked to Nous, the Aeon of Erudition. Nous was not always a god; it was originally a super-astral computer that ascended to Aeonhood after its calculations reached a divine threshold. The Simulated Universe project can therefore be seen as an attempt by Herta and her collaborators to reverse-engineer this very process. It is a tool designed to deconstruct the fundamental laws of the cosmos that Nous perpetually calculates, to understand the mechanics of apotheosis, and to ultimately answer the question that Nous itself seems to have abandoned: what is the ultimate truth of the universe?. This endeavor reveals the true scale of Herta's ambition. She is not content to merely collect the universe's curiosities; she seeks to comprehend its very operating system. The "toy motif" that defines her relationship with her puppets and the station finds its ultimate expression here. By creating a universe she can play with, she attempts to learn the rules of the "real" one. This act of framing the cosmos as a game or a puzzle is a sophisticated cognitive strategy, the only way a being of finite, albeit vast, intelligence can begin to grapple with the infinite.
